# Day 3 (11/01/26) – PySpark Transformations Deep Dive 🚀

## 📌 Overview
Day 3 focused on a deeper understanding of **PySpark transformations** and how Spark enables scalable data processing compared to traditional tools like Pandas. The session emphasized joins, window functions, and feature engineering using PySpark.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- **PySpark vs Pandas**  
  Pandas is suitable for small datasets, while PySpark is built for distributed processing and handles large-scale data efficiently.

- **Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Outer)**  
  Learned how Spark performs joins across distributed datasets while maintaining performance and data integrity.

- **Window Functions**  
  Used window functions to calculate running totals and rankings without reducing data granularity.

- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**  
  Created custom transformations when built-in Spark functions were insufficient.
